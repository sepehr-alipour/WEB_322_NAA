      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>
        My name is Sepehr which means "Sky" in the Persian language. Since
        creating something new always makes me satisfied, I started learning
        programming from my childhood by I386 CPU generation and MS-DOS OS. I
        have some experience in the mobile application development of Android
        and I am passionate about learning new technologies to utilize them in
        my lifestyle. I always try to find automated solutions for routine
        processes.

      <p>
        I love animals and birds are my favorite species because they are always
        free and can travel whenever they prefer
